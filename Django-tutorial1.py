Django's primary goal is to create complex data driven websites. It is essentially a set of modules
built around creating web applications. It is a python framework for web development.

What will this program do? 

This tutorial is for the creation of a basic poll application. 

It has two parts: 

1. A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them

2. An admin site that lets you add change and delete polls

'''

# in mysite folder, type 'python manage.py runserver'
#this will open Djanogo development server. This is a lightweight web server
#It is only to be used for development, it is not for use as a web server. 

#by default: the development server is set to the internal ip: '8000'
# to change server's port: run command 'python manage.py runserver ####'

# to listen on all public IP's 'python manage.py runserver 0:8000'
#0 is a shortcut for 0.0.0.0
